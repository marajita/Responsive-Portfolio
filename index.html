                <p>Hi, I'm Rajita! I am learning web development simply because I loved it. I loved the thrill. I love
                    to
                    see my imagination come to life.
                <br>
                <br>
                I choose to be a web developer to bring my ideas to life and help others see what I think a better
                    world looks like.
                <br>
                <br>
                World wide web is everywhere and everyone is on World wide web. If www didn't existed, We won't be
                    able
                    to google the question that we have and we didn't had an opportunity to express the opinion of the
                    question and as a web developer you have the ability to involve in this movement and be the
                    frontier of
                    the revolution.
